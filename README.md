# Week-1
This project aims to predict the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) using data analysis and machine learning.
# 🚗 EV Adoption Forecasting

This project explores and predicts electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends using machine learning. It uses a real dataset of EV populations by county and applies data visualization and regression techniques to forecast future adoption patterns.

## 📁 Files Included

- `EV_adoption_forcasting.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `Electric_Vehicle_Population_By_County.csv`: Dataset used for training and visualization.
- `README.md`: Project overview.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (data handling)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
- Scikit-learn (machine learning)
- Jupyter Notebook (via VS Code)

## 🔍 Key Features

- Handles missing values and outliers
- Uses Random Forest Regressor to model EV adoption
- Evaluates model using MAE, MSE, and R² Score
- Visualizes EV trends for better understanding

## 📈 Goal

To help understand how electric vehicles are growing across regions and how future adoption can be estimated using machine learning models.

## 📊 Example Output

- Outlier detection using IQR
- Feature importance plot
- Model evaluation metrics
